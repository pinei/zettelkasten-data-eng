We create permanent notes by reviewing what we have written in fleeting notes and in our literature notes.

So the input is the literature notes and the fleeting thoughts they've had, and the output is the permanent note.

> The productivity of a knowledge worker should be tracked by how many permanent notes you produce a day (Sankar Ahrens) 

**Rules**
1. 1 atomic idea per note
2. Express the idea, clearly assuming the reader does not have context
3. Connect them with the other notes in your system

Each note is a building block where you can rearrange and connect with new ideas, old ideas, things that seemingly are not connected.

You want to be able to remove complexity and be able to rearrange these ideas.

We want to make sure that it is expressed clearly without needing a lot of context.

The connections is what makes your knowledge usable.
