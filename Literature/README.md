This is what we write down when we are consuming content.

Whether it's reading a book or an article, listening to a podcast, watching a YouTube video, watching a movie, listening to songs, it doesn't matter what it is.

When you're consuming content, you want to write down literature notes, and these capture: first, one atomic idea each.

So it has to be brief no more than three to five sentences.

Then it also has to be redescribed in your own words so that you internalize what is being said.

You also want to be able to note down the references so you know exactly where it came from, and you can always go back to reference it.
